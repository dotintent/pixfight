This is an opensource crossplatform pixelart turn based strategy with AI done in C++14 with OpenGL 2.0 ES / 3.2 Core. With native applications for each platform (iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Android)

#1. Idea

The root idea behind this project is to show how to integrate C++ code with some 3rd party libraries into your native application done in other platforms as a "business logic" Core game logic is written in C++14 and use FMOD, OpenGL and freetype2 as dependencies. Each platform uses this Core to render game in their native environment. (Eg Android in Java, iOS in objC etc.)
