# Pixfight

This is an opensource crossplatform clone of [WeeWar](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315005124/http://weewar.com/) pixelart turn based strategy with AI. Done in C++14 with OpenGL 2.0 ES / 3.2 Core. With native applications for each platform (iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, HTML5, Raspberry-Pi) 

## System Requirements:

Basically this should run on modern sandwich toasters: 

* 32Bit operating system 
* Single core CPU running at about 800Mhz (dual core 1Ghz recommended)
* 128MB RAM (256 recommended)
* GPU able to run GL2.0 ES or 3.2Core Profile with about 128MB (256 recommended)
* About 20MB disk space (depends on platform and build type)
* Music card (PC) 
* Mouse (PC)
* Monitor capable of running in 16bit colour mode with at least 1024x768 resolution (PC)

## Controls

Desktop:

* RMB move map
* LMB select
* Scroll wheel to zoom

Mobile:

* pinch to scale 
* use two fingers to move
* tap to select unit 
  
## How to play:

Your main task is to capture all bases on the map, to do that you need infantry units. Capturing the base take 2 turns. You can repair a damaged unit (not infantry unit) if you move it back into your own base. Repair cost 1 turn.
If a unit stays on base it gets extra defence bonus. Each turn you earn (N+1 * 100) of cash where N is amount of bases captured by you.

* Click / tap on base to open build menu

* After selecting a unit it will show its area of movement, tap within grey area to select path and confirm it by tapping again by tapping / clicking on destination point.
* To attack tap/klick on your unit and select a unit to attack (if you are close enough / artillery uses range of movement)

# 1. Idea

The root idea behind this project is to show how to integrate C++ code with some 3rd party libraries into your native application, done in other platforms as a "business logic" Core game logic is written in C++14 and uses FMOD, OpenGL and freetype2 as dependencies. Each platform uses this Core to render game in their native environment. (e.g: Android in Java, iOS in objC etc.)

AI in this game is based on the following article from [gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/129959/designing_ai_algorithms_for_.php)

Inspiration for the game comes from [WeeWar](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315005124/http://weewar.com/) (no longer exists)

sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
```

Also run codeblocks from terminal with sudo command to let it copy FMOD libs to `usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`

or copy them manually and remove following lines from pre-build steps in project:

```
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so.10" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so.10" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so.10.3" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so.10.3" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
```

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/Linux
* Open pixfight.cbp project file
* Press F9 or play button to build and run.

### RaspberryPi

You need to install [codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org) to compile this project.

Before compiling and running you need to download additional libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev 
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
```

Also run codeblocks from terminal with sudo command to let it copy FMOD libs to `usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf`

Before compiling and running make sure your RaspberryPi is working with hardware driver for opengl:

**Keep in mind this is experimental Driver and its not finished**

Open terminal and type:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo raspi-config
```

You will now see RPi configuration menu.

* Go to 7 Advanced Options 
* A3 Memory Split 
* Set Amount to at least 256
* Get back to Advanced Options
* Choose A7 GL Driver
* Set it to G1 GL (Full KMS)
* Confirm and reboot

More info can be found [here](http://www.raspberryconnect.com/gamessoftware/item/314-trying_out_opengl_on_raspberry_pi_3)

After reboot you are ready to go.

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/RaspberryPi
* Open pixfight.cbp project file
* Press F9 or play button to build and run.

### Windows

This project require at least `Visual Studio 2017 community version`  	 

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/Windows/pixfight
* Open pixfight.sln
* Press F5 or play button to build and run.

### HTML5

HTML5 version is experimental. It's a fully working game but lacks saving and multithreading* (read below how to enable threads) 

To build it you need to download and install [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) (please follow instructions on site)

* Open Terminal or shell
* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/HTML5
* Type `emmake make` 
* Build will be placed in `bin` directory  

To run game you will need to start some local server e.g: by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the same directory where you run `enmake make`  

Now open browser and type `localhost:8000` it will open in `HTML5` directory. Navigate to `bin` and klick on `pixfight.html` the game will now run.

**Threads support: (Chrome)**

To enable threads in HTML5 you need to open `Makefile` in text editor and uncomment line 14 `EMFLAGS += -s USE_PTHREADS=1`

Next you need to open chrome and type: `chrome://flags/` and activate:

`Experimental enabled SharedArrayBuffer support in JavaScript.`

This will give support for real multithreading in game (using std::thread) simply rebuild game and run it again.

### Mapeditor

Editor uses `Makefile`, you need to install `cmake` to compile and build.

* Open bash console (on Windows you can use mingw)
* Navigate to pixfight/MAPEDITOR/
* Type `make` and tap enter
* Binaries with additional catalogues will be placed in `bin` directory

To run on macOS / Linux navigate to `bin` directory and type `./editor`. Windows will generate appropriate `*.exe` file

To build it on Windows you will need to install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) with `gcc` compiler as dependency. Also you need to download [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/) and copy content of `lib` and `include` directories to appropriate folders in `C:\MinGW\` (Please choose mingw32 libraries)

If you have problems running editor on macOS (mostly High Sierra) you will need to manually download [glfw source code](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and follow this steps: (then rebuild)  

* Download and extract the GLFW source code  
* Open the Terminal  
* `cd` to the extracted directory  
* Type in `cmake .`, hit return  
* A Makefile will be created for you  
* Type in `make`, hit return  
* After the compilation process, type in `sudo make install`  
* The libraries will be copied to `/usr/local/lib/`, the header files to `/usr/local/include/`  

### Server

Server uses `Makefile`, you need to install `cmake` to compile and build.

* Open bash console (on Windows you can use mingw)
* Navigate to pixfight/SERVER/PFServer/
* Type `make` and tap enter
* Binaries with additional catalogues will be placed in `bin` directory

If you want to run your own dedicated server on e.g: vps, build server on linux and replace `DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDR` with your server IP and rebuild game.

**Current server location is in Europe - UK**

# 5. Next steps  
  
* Nintendo Switch Version
  
* Map terrain types will affect unit stats. (Grass, Woods, Sand, Mud etc)
